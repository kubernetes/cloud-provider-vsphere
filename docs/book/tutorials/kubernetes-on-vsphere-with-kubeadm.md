# Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster on vSphere with CSI and CPI

The purpose of this guide is to provide the reader with step by step instructions on how to deploy Kubernetes on vSphere infrastructure. The instructions use `kubeadm`, a tool built to provide best-practice “fast paths” for creating Kubernetes clusters. The reader will also learn how to deploy the Container Storage Interface and Cloud Provider Interface plugins for vSphere specific operations. At the end of this tutorial you will have a fully running K8s on vSphere environment that allows for dynamic provisioning of volumes.

## Prerequisites

This section will cover the prerequisites that need to be in place before attempting the deployment.

### vSphere requirements

vSphere 6.7U3 (or later) is a prerequisite for using CSI and CPI at the time of writing. This may change going forward, and the documentation will be updated to reflect any changes in this support statement. If you are on a vSphere version that is below 6.7 U3, you can either upgrade vSphere to 6.7U3 or follow one of the tutorials for earlier vSphere versions. Here is the tutorial on deploying Kubernetes with kubeadm, using the VCP - [Deploying Kubernetes using kubeadm with the vSphere Cloud Provider (in-tree)](./k8s-vcp-on-vsphere-with-kubeadm.md).

### Firewall requirements

Providing the K8s master node(s) access to the vCenter management interface will be sufficient, given the CPI and CSI pods are deployed on the master node(s). Should these components be deployed on worker nodes or otherwise - those nodes will also need access to the vCenter management interface.

If you want to use topology-aware volume provisioning and the late binding feature using `zone`/`region`, the node need to discover its topology by connecting to the vCenter, for this every node should be able to communicate to the vCenter. You can disable this optional feature if you want to open only the master node to the vCenter management interface.

### Recommended Guest Operating System

VMware recommends that you create a virtual machine template using Guest OS Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS (Bionic Beaver) 64-bit PC (AMD64) Server. Check it out on [VMware PartnerWeb](http://partnerweb.vmware.com/GOSIG/Ubuntu_18_04_LTS.html). This template is cloned to act as base images for your Kubernetes cluster. For instructions on how to do this, please refer to the guidance provided in [this blog post by Myles Gray of VMware](https://blah.cloud/kubernetes/creating-an-ubuntu-18-04-lts-cloud-image-for-cloning-on-vmware/). Ensure that SSH access is enabled on all nodes. This must be done in order to run commands on both the Kubernetes master and worker nodes in this guide.

### Virtual Machine Hardware requirements

Virtual Machine Hardware must be version 15 or higher. For Virtual Machine CPU and Memory requirements, size adequately based on workload requirements.
VMware also recommend that virtual machines use the VMware Paravirtual SCSI controller for Primary Disk on the Node VM. This should be the default, but it is always good practice to check.
Finally, the disk.EnableUUID parameter must be set for each node VMs. This step is necessary so that the VMDK always presents a consistent UUID to the VM, thus allowing the disk to be mounted properly.
It is recommended to not take snapshots of CNS node VMs to avoid errors and unpredictable behavior.

### Docker Images

The following is the list of docker images that are required for the installation of CSI and CPI on Kubernetes. These images are automatically pulled in when CSI and CPI manifests are deployed.
VMware distributes and recommends the following images:

```bash
gcr.io/cloud-provider-vsphere/csi/release/driver:v1.0.1
gcr.io/cloud-provider-vsphere/csi/release/syncer:v1.0.1
http://gcr.io/cloud-provider-vsphere/cpi/release/manager:v1.0.0
```

In addition, you can use the following images or any of the open source or commercially available container images appropriate for the CSI deployment. Note that the tags reference the version of various components. This will change with future versions:

```bash
quay.io/k8scsi/csi-provisioner:v1.2.2
quay.io/k8scsi/csi-attacher:v1.1.1
quay.io/k8scsi/csi-node-driver-registrar:v1.1.0
quay.io/k8scsi/livenessprobe:v1.1.0
k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.14.2
k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager:v1.14.2
k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler:v1.14.2
k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy:v1.14.2
k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.1
k8s.gcr.io/etcd:3.3.10
k8s.gcr.io/coredns:1.3.1
```

### Tools

If you plan to deploy Kubernetes on vSphere  from a MacOS environment, the `brew` package manager may be used to install and manage the necessary tools. If using Linux or Windows environment to initiate the deployment, links to the tools are included. Follow the tool specific instructions for installing the tools on the different operating systems.

For each tool, the brew install command for MacOS is shown here.

* `brew` - <https://brew.sh>
* `govc` - brew tap govmomi/tap/govc && brew install govmomi/tap/govc
* `kubectl` - brew install kubernetes-cli
* `tmux` (optional) - brew install tmux

Here are the links to the tools and install instructions for other operating systems:

* [govc for other Operating Systems](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc) - version 0.20.0 or higher recommended
* [kubectl for other Operating Systems](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [tmux for other Operating Systems](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Setting up VMs and Guest OS

The next step is to install the necessary Kubernetes components on the Ubuntu OS virtual machines. Some components must be installed on all of the nodes. In other cases, some of the components need only be installed on the master, and in other cases, only the workers. In each case, where the components are installed is highlighted.
All installation and configuration commands should be executed with root privilege. You can switch to the root environment using the "sudo su" command.
Setup steps required on all nodes
The following section details the steps that are needed on both the master and worker nodes.

### disk.EnableUUID=1

The following govc commands will set the disk.EnableUUID=1 on all nodes.

```bash
# export GOVC_INSECURE=1
# export GOVC_URL='https://<VC_IP>'
# export GOVC_USERNAME=VC_Admin_User
# export GOVC_PASSWORD=VC_Admin_Passwd

# govc ls
/datacenter/vm
/datacenter/network
/datacenter/host
/datacenter/datastore
```

To retrieve all Node VMs, use the following command:

```bash
# govc ls /<datacenter-name>/vm
/datacenter/vm/k8s-node3
/datacenter/vm/k8s-node4
/datacenter/vm/k8s-node1
/datacenter/vm/k8s-node2
/datacenter/vm/k8s-master
```

To use govc to enable Disk UUID, use the following command:

```bash
# govc vm.change -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node1' -e="disk.enableUUID=1"
# govc vm.change -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node2' -e="disk.enableUUID=1"
# govc vm.change -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node3' -e="disk.enableUUID=1"
# govc vm.change -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node4' -e="disk.enableUUID=1"
# govc vm.change -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-master' -e="disk.enableUUID=1"
```

Further information on disk.enableUUID can be found in [VMware Knowledgebase Article 52815](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52815).

### Upgrade Virtual Machine Hardware

VM Hardware should be at version 15 or higher.

```bash
# govc vm.upgrade -version=15 -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node1'
# govc vm.upgrade -version=15 -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node2'
# govc vm.upgrade -version=15 -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node3'
# govc vm.upgrade -version=15 -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node4'
# govc vm.upgrade -version=15 -vm '/datacenter/vm/k8s-master'
```

Check the VM Hardware version after running the above command:

```bash
# govc vm.option.info '/datacenter/vm/k8s-node1' | grep HwVersion
HwVersion:           15
```

### Disable Swap

SSH into all K8s worker nodes and disable swap on all nodes including master node. This is a prerequisite for kubeadm. IF you have followed the previous guidance on how to create the OS template image, this step will have already been implemented.

```bash
# swapoff -a
# vi /etc/fstab
... remove any swap entry from this file ...
```

### Install Docker CE

The following steps should be used to install the container runtime on all of the nodes. Docker CE 18.06 must be used. Kubernetes has explicit supported versions, so it has to be this version

First, update the apt package index.

```bash
# apt update
```

The next step is to install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS.

```bash
# apt install ca-certificates software-properties-common \
apt-transport-https curl -y
```

Now add Docker’s official GPG key.

```bash
# curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
```

To complete the install, add the docker apt repository.

```bash
# add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
```

Now we can install Docker CE. To install a specific version, replace the version string with the desired version number.

```bash
# apt update
# apt install docker-ce=18.06.0~ce~3-0~ubuntu -y
```

Finally, setup the daemon parameters, like log rotation and cgroups.

```bash
# tee /etc/docker/daemon.json >/dev/null <<EOF
{
  "exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"],
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m"
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
EOF
```

```bash
# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
```

And to complete, restart docker to pickup the new parameters.

```bash
# systemctl daemon-reload
```

```bash
# systemctl restart docker
```

Docker is now installed. Verify the status of docker via the following command:

```bash
#systemctl status docker
 docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2019-09-06 12:37:27 UTC; 4min 15s ago

#docker info | egrep "Server Version|Cgroup Driver"
Server Version: 18.06.0-ce
Cgroup Driver: systemd
```

### Install Kubelet, Kubectl, Kubeadm

The next step is to install the main Kubernetes components on each of the nodes.

`kubeadm` is the command to bootstrap the cluster. It runs on the master and all worker nodes.
`kubelet` is the component that runs on all nodes in the cluster and performs such tasks as starting pods and containers.
`kubectl` is the command line utility to communicate with your cluster. It runs only on the master node.
For Ubuntu distributions, a specific version can be installed with specifying version of the package name, e.g. `apt install -qy kubeadm=1.14.2-00 kubelet=1.14.2-00 kubectl=1.14.2-00`. These should be the minimum versions installed.

First, the Kubernetes repository needs to be added to apt.

```bash
# curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
```

```bash
# cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
```

Next, install kubelet, kubectl and kubeadm.

```bash
# apt update

# apt install -qy kubeadm=1.14.2-00 kubelet=1.14.2-00 kubectl=1.14.2-00
```

Finally, hold Kubernetes packages at their installed version so as not to upgrade unexpectedly on an apt upgrade.

```bash
# apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

### Setup step for flannel (Pod Networking)

We will be using flannel for pod networking in this example, so the below needs to be run on all nodes to pass bridged IPv4 traffic to iptables chains:

```bash
# sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
```

That completes the common setup steps across both masters and worker nodes. We will now look at the steps involved in enabling the vSphere Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) and Container Storage Interface (CSI) before we are ready to deploy our Kubernetes cluster. Pay attention to where the steps are carried out, which will be either on the master or the worker nodes.

## Installing the Kubernetes master node(s)

Again, these steps are only carried out on the master. Use kubeadminit to initialize the master node. In order to initialize the master node, we need to first of all create a `kubeadminit.yaml` manifest file that needs to be passed to the `kubeadm` command. Note the reference to an external cloud provider in the `nodeRegistration` part of the manifest.

```bash
# tee /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminit.yaml >/dev/null <<EOF
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: InitConfiguration
bootstrapTokens:
       - groups:
         - system:bootstrappers:kubeadm:default-node-token
         token: y7yaev.9dvwxx6ny4ef8vlq
         ttl: 0s
         usages:
         - signing
         - authentication
nodeRegistration:
  kubeletExtraArgs:
    cloud-provider: external
---
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterConfiguration
useHyperKubeImage: false
kubernetesVersion: v1.14.2
networking:
  serviceSubnet: "10.96.0.0/12"
  podSubnet: "10.244.0.0/16"
etcd:
  local:
    imageRepository: "k8s.gcr.io"
    imageTag: "3.3.10"
dns:
  type: "CoreDNS"
  imageRepository: "k8s.gcr.io"
  imageTag: "1.5.0"
EOF
```

Bootstrap the Kubernetes master node using the cluster configuration file created in the step above.

```bash
# kubeadm init --config /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminit.yaml
[init] Using Kubernetes version: v1.14.2
. .
. .
[preflight] Pulling images required for setting up a Kubernetes cluster
[preflight] This might take a minute or two, depending on the speed of your internet connection
[preflight] You can also perform this action in beforehand using 'kubeadm config images pull'
. .
. .
You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.192.116.47:6443 --token y7yaev.9dvwxx6ny4ef8vlq \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:[sha sum from above output]
```

Note that the last part of the output provides the command to join the worker nodes to the master in this Kubernetes cluster. We will return to that step shortly. Next, setup the kubeconfig file on the master so that Kubernetes CLI commands such as kubectl may be used on your newly created Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
# mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
```

```bash
# cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
```

You can also use `kubectl` on external (non-master) systems by copying the contents of the master’s `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` to your local computer's `~/.kube/config` file.

At this stage, you may notice coredns pods remain in the pending state with `FailedScheduling` status. This is because the master node has taints that the coredns pods cannot tolerate. This is expected, as we have started `kubelet` with `cloud-provider: external`. Once the vSphere Cloud Provider Interface is installed, and the nodes are initialized, the taints will be automatically removed from node, and that will allow scheduling of the coreDNS pods.

```bash
# kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-fb8b8dccf-q57f9              0/1       Pending   0          87s

kube-scheduler-k8s-master            1/1       Running   0          37s
```

```bash
# kubectl describe pod coredns-fb8b8dccf-q57f9 --namespace=kube-system
.
.
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age                 From               Message

  Warning  FailedScheduling  7s (x21 over 2m1s)  default-scheduler  0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had taints that the pod didn't tolerate.
```

### Install flannel pod overlay networking

The next step that needs to be carried out on the master node is that the flannel pod overlay network must be installed so the pods can communicate with each other.
The command to install flannel on the master is as follows:

```bash
# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/62e44c867a2846fefb68bd5f178daf4da3095ccb/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

Please follow [these alternative instructions to install a pod overlay network other than flannel](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/#pod-network).

At this point, you can check if the overlay network is deployed.

```bash
# kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-6557d7f7d6-9s7sm           0/1     Pending   0          107s
coredns-6557d7f7d6-wgxtq           0/1     Pending   0          107s
etcd-k8s-mstr                      1/1     Running   0          70s

kube-controller-manager-k8s-mstr   1/1     Running   0          53s
kube-flannel-ds-amd64-pm9m9        1/1     Running   0          11s
kube-proxy-8dfm9                   1/1     Running   0          107s
kube-scheduler-k8s-mstr            1/1     Running   0          49s
```

### Export the master node configuration

Finally, the master node configuration needs to be exported as it is used by the worker nodes wishing to join to the master.

```bash
# kubectl -n kube-public get configmap cluster-info -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' > discovery.yaml
```

The `discovery.yaml` file will need to be copied to `/etc/kubernetes/discovery.yaml` on each of the worker nodes.

## Installing the Kubernetes worker node(s)

Perform this task on the worker nodes. Verify that you have installed Docker CE, kubeadm, etc, on the worker nodes before attempting to add them to the master.

To have the worker node(s) join to the master, a worker node kubeadm config yaml file must be created. Notice it is using `/etc/kubernetes/discovery.yaml` as the input for master discovery. We will show how to copy the file from the workers to the master in the next step. Also, notice that the token used in the worker node config is the same as we put in the master `kubeadminitmaster.yaml` configuration above. Finally, we once more specify that the cloud-provider is external for the workers, as we are going to use the new CPI.

```bash
# tee /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminitworker.yaml >/dev/null <<EOF
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
caCertPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
discovery:
  file:
    kubeConfigPath: /etc/kubernetes/discovery.yaml
  timeout: 5m0s
  tlsBootstrapToken: y7yaev.9dvwxx6ny4ef8vlq
kind: JoinConfiguration
nodeRegistration:
  criSocket: /var/run/dockershim.sock
  kubeletExtraArgs:
    cloud-provider: external
EOF
```

You can copy the `discovery.yaml` to your local machine with `scp`.

First, as superuser, use `scp` to copy `/etc/kubernetes/discovery.yaml` on the master to `/home/ubuntu/discovery.yaml` on all the nodes.

You will now need to login to each of the nodes and copy the `discovery.yaml` file from `/home/ubuntu` to `/etc/kubernetes`. The `discovery.yaml` file must exist in `/etc/kubernetes` on the nodes.

Once that step is completed, run the following command on each worker node to have it join the master (and other worker nodes that are already joined) in the cluster:

```bash
# kubeadm join --config /etc/kubernetes/kubeadminitworker.yaml
```

You can check if the node has joined by running `# kubectl get nodes` on the master.

## Install the vSphere Cloud Provider Interface

The following steps are only done on the master. Please note that the CSI driver requires the presence of the Cloud Provider Interface (CPI), so the step of installing the CPI is mandatory.

### Create a CPI configMap

This cloud-config configmap file, passed to the CPI on initialization, contains details about the vSphere configuration. This file, which here we have called `vsphere.conf` has been populated with some sample values. Obviously, you will need to modify this file to reflect your own vSphere configuration.

```bash
# tee /etc/kubernetes/vsphere.conf >/dev/null <<EOF

# Global properties in this section will be used for all specified vCenters unless overriden in VirtualCenter section.
global:
  port: "443"
  # set insecure-flag to true if the vCenter uses a self-signed cert
  insecure-flag: true
  # settings for using k8s secret
  secret-name: cpi-global-secret
  secret-namespace: kube-system

# VirtualCenter section
virtualcenter:
  tenant-finance:
    server: 1.1.1.1
    datacenters:
      - globalfinanace
  tenant-hr:
    server: 192.168.0.1
    datacenters:
      - hrwest
      - hreast
  tenant-engineering:
    server: 10.0.0.1
    datacenters:
      - engrwest1
      - engrwest2
    secret-name: cpi-engineering-secret
    secret-namespace: kube-system

# labels for regions and zones
labels:
  region: k8s-region
  zone: k8s-zone

EOF
```

Here is a description of the fields used in the vsphere.conf configmap.

* `insecure-flag` should be set to true to use self-signed certificate for login.
* `server` section is defined to hold property of vcenter IP address or FQDN.
* `secret-name` holds the credential(s) for a single or list of vCenter Servers.
* `secret-namespace` is set to the namespace where the secret has been created.
* `port` is the vCenter Server Port. The default is 443 if not specified.
* `datacenters` should be the list of datacenters where kubernetes node VMs are present.

Create the configmap by running the following command:

```bash
# cd /etc/kubernetes
```

```bash
# kubectl create configmap cloud-config --from-file=vsphere.conf --namespace=kube-system
```

Verify that the configmap has been successfully created in the kube-system namespace.

```bash
# kubectl get configmap cloud-config --namespace=kube-system
NAME              DATA     AGE
cloud-config      1        82s
```

### Create a CPI secret

The CPI supports storing vCenter credentials either in:

* a shared global secret containing all vCenter credentials, or
* a secret dedicated for a particular vCenter configuration which takes precedence over anything that might be configured within the global secret

In the example `vsphere.conf` above, there are two configured [Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#using-secrets). The vCenter at `10.0.0.1` contains credentials in the secret named `cpi-engineering-secret` in the namespace `kube-system` and the vCenter at `1.1.1.1` and `192.168.0.1` contains credentials in the secret named `cpi-global-secret` in the namespace `kube-system` defined in the `global:` section.

An example [Secrets YAML](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/raw/master/manifests/controller-manager/vccm-secret.yaml) can be used for reference when creating your own `secrets`. If the example secret YAML is used, update the secret name to use a `<unique secret name>`, the vCenter IP address in the keys of `stringData`, and the `username` and `password` for each key.

The secret for the vCenter at `1.1.1.1` might look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cpi-engineering-secret
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  10.0.0.1.username: "administrator@vsphere.local"
  10.0.0.1.password: "password"
```

Then to create the secret, run the following command replacing the name of the YAML file with the one you have used:

```bash
# kubectl create -f cpi-engineering-secret.yaml
```

Verify that the credential secret is successfully created in the kube-system namespace.

```bash
# kubectl get secret cpi-engineering-secret --namespace=kube-system
NAME                    TYPE     DATA   AGE
cpi-engineering-secret   Opaque   1      43s
```

If you have multiple vCenters as in the example vsphere.conf above, your Kubernetes Secret YAML could look like the following to storage the vCenter credentials for vCenters at `1.1.1.1` and `192.168.0.1`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: cpi-global-secret
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  1.1.1.1.username: "administrator@vsphere.local"
  1.1.1.1.password: "password"
  192.168.0.1.username: "administrator@vsphere.local"
  192.168.0.1.password: "password"
```

### Zones and Regions for Pod and Volume Placement - CPI

Kubernetes allows you to place Pods and Persisent Volumes on specific parts of the underlying infrastructure, e.g. different DataCenters or different vCenters, using the concept of Zones and Regions. However, to use placement controls, the required configuration steps needs to be put in place at Kubernetes deployment time, and require additional settings in the vSphere.conf of both the CPI and CSI. For more information on how to implement zones/regions support, [there is a zones/regions tutorial on how to do it here](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/blob/master/docs/book/tutorials/deploying_cpi_and_csi_with_multi_dc_vc_aka_zones.md).

If you are not interested in K8s object placement, this section can be ignored, and you can proceed with the remaining CPI setup steps.

### Check that all nodes are tainted

Before installing vSphere Cloud Controller Manager, make sure all nodes are tainted with `node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule`. When the kubelet is started with “external” cloud provider, this taint is set on a node to mark it as unusable. After a controller from the cloud provider initializes this node, the kubelet removes this taint.

```bash
# kubectl describe nodes | egrep "Taints:|Name:"
Name:               k8s-master
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule
Name:               k8s-node1
Taints:             node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule
Name:               k8s-node2
Taints:             node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule
Name:               k8s-node3
Taints:             node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule
Name:               k8s-node4
Taints:             node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized=true:NoSchedule
```

### Deploy the CPI manifests

There are 3 manifests that must be deployed to install the vSphere Cloud Provider Interface. The following example applies the RBAC roles and the RBAC bindings to your Kubernetes cluster. It also deploys the Cloud Controller Manager in a DaemonSet.

```bash
# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/master/manifests/controller-manager/cloud-controller-manager-roles.yaml
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:cloud-controller-manager created

# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/master/manifests/controller-manager/cloud-controller-manager-role-bindings.yaml
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:cloud-controller-manager created

# kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/raw/master/manifests/controller-manager/vsphere-cloud-controller-manager-ds.yaml
serviceaccount/cloud-controller-manager created
daemonset.extensions/vsphere-cloud-controller-manager created
service/vsphere-cloud-controller-manager created
```

### Verify that the CPI has been successfully deployed

Verify vsphere-cloud-controller-manager is running and all other system pods are up and running (note that the coredns pods were not running previously - they should be running now as the taints have been removed by installing the CPI):

```bash
# kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
coredns-fb8b8dccf-bq7qq                  1/1     Running   0          71m
coredns-fb8b8dccf-r47q2                  1/1     Running   0          71m
etcd-k8s-master                          1/1     Running   0          69m

kube-proxy-vh4lg                         1/1     Running   0          38m
kube-scheduler-k8s-master                1/1     Running   0          70m
vsphere-cloud-controller-manager-549hb   1/1     Running   0          25s
```

### Check that all nodes are untainted

Verify node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint is removed from all nodes.

```bash
# kubectl describe nodes | egrep "Taints:|Name:"
Name:               k8s-master
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule
Name:               k8s-node1
Taints:             <none>
Name:               k8s-node2
Taints:             <none>
Name:               k8s-node3
Taints:             <none>
Name:               k8s-node4
Taints:             <none>
```

Note: If you happen to make an error with the `vsphere.conf`, simply delete the CPI components and the configMap, make any necessary edits to the configMap `vSphere.conf` file, and reapply the steps above.

You may now remove the `vsphere.conf` file created at `/etc/kubernetes/`.

## Install vSphere Container Storage Interface Driver

Now that the CPI is installed, we can focus on the CSI. Perform the following steps on the Master Node(s) only.
The master node(s) should be tainted to prevent scheduling. This should already be the case. You can check as follows:

```bash
# kubectl describe nodes | egrep "Taints:|Name:"
Name:               k8s-mstr
Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule
Name:               k8s-worker-01
Taints:             <none>
Name:               k8s-worker-02
Taints:             <none>
```

The `node-role.kubernetes.io/master=:NoSchedule` taint is required to be present on the master nodes to prevent scheduling of the node plugin pods for `vsphere-csi-node` daemonset on the master nodes. Should you need to readd the taint, you can use the following command:

```bash
# kubectl taint nodes k8s-master node-role.kubernetes.io/master=:NoSchedule
```

### Create a CSI secret

Just like we saw with the CPI, this credential secret, passed to the CSI on initialization, contains details about the vSphere configuration. This `csi-vsphere.conf` has been populated with some sample values. Obviously, you will need to modify this file to reflect your own vSphere configuration. This is very important since it will avoid potential persistent volume (PV) name collissions.

For information about using a certificate and private key instead of a username and password in plain text, see Use Certificate to Secure vCenter Server Connections.

```bash
# tee /etc/kubernetes/csi-vsphere.conf >/dev/null <<EOF
[Global]
cluster-id = "demo-cluster-id"
[VirtualCenter "1.1.1.1"]
insecure-flag = "true"
user = "Administrator@vsphere.local"
password = "password"
port = "443"
datacenters = "datacenter"
EOF
```

The entries in the csi-vsphere.conf file have the following meanings:

* `cluster-id` represents the unique cluster identifier. Each kubernetes cluster should have it's own unique cluster-id set in the csi-vsphere.conf file.
* `VirtualCenter` section defines vCenter IP address / FQDN.
* `insecure-flag` should be set to true to use self-signed certificate for login
* `user` is the vCenter username for vSphere Cloud Provider.
* `password` is the password for vCenter user specified with user.
* `port` is the vCenter Server Port. The default is 443 if not specified.
* `datacenters` should be the list of all comma separated datacenters where kubernetes node VMs are present.

Create the secret by running the following command:

```bash
# cd /etc/kubernetes
```

```bash
# kubectl create secret generic vsphere-config-secret --from-file=csi-vsphere.conf --namespace=kube-system
```

Verify that the credential secret is successfully created in the kube-system namespace.

```bash
# kubectl get secret vsphere-config-secret --namespace=kube-system
NAME                    TYPE     DATA   AGE
vsphere-config-secret   Opaque   1      43s
```

You may now remove the `csi-vsphere.conf` file created at `/etc/kubernetes/`.

```bash
# rm /etc/kubernetes/csi-vsphere.conf
```

### Zones and Regions for Pod and Volume Placement - CSI

Kubernetes allows you to place Pods and Persisent Volumes on specific parts of the underlying infrastructure, e.g. different DataCenters or different vCenters, using the concept of Zones and Regions. However, to use placement controls, the required configuration steps needs to be put in place at Kubernetes deployment time, and require additional settings in the vSphere.conf of both the CPI and CSI. For more information on how to implement zones/regions support, [there is a zones/regions tutorial on how to do it here](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/blob/master/docs/book/tutorials/deploying_cpi_and_csi_with_multi_dc_vc_aka_zones.md).

If you are not interested in K8s object placement, this section can be ignored and you can proceed with the remaining CSI setup steps.

### Create Roles, ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding

In these steps, the ClusterRole, ServiceAccounts and ClusterRoleBinding needed for installation of vSphere CSI Driver are created. All of these are in the following manifest. You can use `kubectl` to import the manifest into your cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver/master/manifests/1.14/rbac/vsphere-csi-controller-rbac.yaml
serviceaccount/vsphere-csi-controller created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/vsphere-csi-controller-role created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/vsphere-csi-controller-binding created
```

## Install the vSphere CSI driver

This rather large manifest has all of the necessary component of the vSphere CSI driver. It has the StatefulSet for the CSI controller, CSI attacher, CSI Provisioner and vSphere syncer pods (the latter is used by our new Cloud Native Storage feature). There is also a DaemonSet for the CSI component that will run on every node. It also has the definition for some of the new CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) which we shall see shortly. Once again, you can use `kubectl` to import the manifest into your cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver/master/manifests/1.14/deploy/vsphere-csi-controller-ss.yaml
statefulset.apps/vsphere-csi-controller created
csidriver.storage.k8s.io/csi.vsphere.vmware.com created
```

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver/master/manifests/1.14/deploy/vsphere-csi-node-ds.yaml
daemonset.apps/vsphere-csi-node created
```

### Verify that CSI has been successfully deployed

To verify that the CSI driver has been successfully deployed, you should observe that there is one instance of the vsphere-csi-controller running on the master node and that an instance of the vsphere-csi-node is running on each of the worker nodes.

```bash
# kubectl get statefulset --namespace=kube-system
NAME                          READY   AGE
vsphere-csi-controller        1/1     2m58s
 ```

 If there are any issues, run a `kubectl describe` on the statefulset and see if there are any complaints in the events.

 ```bash
# kubectl get daemonsets vsphere-csi-node --namespace=kube-system
NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
vsphere-csi-node   4         4         4       4            4           <none>          3m51s
 ```

The number of csi-nodes depends on the size of the cluster. There is one per Kubernetes worker node.

 ```bash
# kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Verify that the CSI Custom Resource Definitions are working

As pointed out earlier in the manifests, there are some new CRDs also deployed with the CSI driver. Let’s check that they are also working. The first one examines the CSINode CRD.

```bash
# kubectl get CSINode

### Verify your Cluster Setup

On the master node, verify that all nodes have joined the cluster and that the Provider ID is set up correctly.
Verify that all nodes are participating in the cluster

Use `kubectl` to check that all nodes have joined the cluster

```bash
# kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
k8s-master Ready master 5m13s v1.14.2
k8s-node1  Ready <none>   23s v1.14.2
k8s-node2  Ready <none>   23s v1.14.2
k8s-node3  Ready <none>   23s v1.14.2
k8s-node4  Ready <none>   23s v1.14.2
```

### Verify ProviderID has been added the nodes

## Sample manifests to test CSI driver functionality

The following are some sample manifests that can be used to verify that some provisioning workflows using the vSphere CSI driver are working as expected.

The example provided here will show how to create a stateful containerized application and use the vSphere Client to access the volumes that back your application.
The following sample workflow shows how to deploy a MongoDB application with one replica.

While performing the workflow tasks, you alternate the roles of a vSphere user and Kubernetes user. The tasks use the following items:

* Storage class YAML file
* MongoDB service YAML file
* MongoDB StatefulSet YAML file

### Create a Storage Policy

The virtual disk (VMDK) that will back your containerized application needs to meet specific storage requirements. As a vSphere user, you create a VM storage policy based on the requirements provided to you by the Kubernetes user.
The storage policy will be associated with the VMDK backing your application.
If you have multiple vCenter Server instances in your environment, create the VM storage policy on each instance. Use the same policy name across all instances.

* In the vSphere Client, on the main landing page, select `VM Storage Policies`.
* Under `Policies and Profiles`, select `VM Storage Policies`.
* Click `Create VM Storage Policy`.
* Enter the policy name and description, and click Next. For the purposes of this demonstration we will name it `Space-Efficient`.
* On the Policy structure page under Datastore-specific rules, select `Enable rules for "vSAN" storage` and click Next.
* On the vSAN page, we will keep the defaults for this policy, which is `standard cluster` and `RAID-1 (Mirroring)`.
* On the Storage compatibility page, review the list of vSAN datastores that match this policy and click Next.
* On the Review and finish page, review the policy settings, and click Finish.

You can now inform the Kubernetes user of the storage policy name. The VM storage policy you created will be used as a part of storage class definition for dynamic volume provisioning.

### Create a StorageClass

As a Kubernetes user, define and deploy the storage class that references previously created VM storage policy. We will use kubectl to perform the following steps. Generally, you provide the information to kubectl in a YAML file. kubectl converts the information to JSON when making the API request. We will now create a StorageClass YAML file that describes storage requirements for the container and references the VM storage policy to be used. The `csi.vsphere.vmware.com` is the name of the vSphere CSI provisioner, and is what is placed in the provisioner field in the StorageClass yaml. The following sample YAML file includes the Space-Efficient storage policy that you created earlier using the vSphere Client. The resulting persistent volume VMDK is placed on a compatible datastore with the maximum free space that satisfies the Space-Efficient storage policy requirements.

```bash
# cat mongodb-storageclass.yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: mongodb-sc
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
provisioner: csi.vsphere.vmware.com
parameters:
  storagepolicyname: "Space-Efficient"
  fstype: ext4
```

```bash
# kubectl create -f mongodb-storageclass.yaml
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/mongodb-sc created
```

```bash
# kubectl get storageclass mongodb-sc
NAME         PROVISIONER                    AGE
mongodb-sc   csi.vsphere.vmware.com   5s
```

### Create a Service

As a Kubernetes user, define and deploy a Kubernetes Service. The Service provides a networking endpoint for the application.
The following is a sample YAML file that defines the service for the MongoDB application.

```bash
# cat mongodb-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb-service
  labels:
    name: mongodb-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    role: mongo
```

```bash
# kubectl create -f mongodb-service.yaml
service/mongodb-service created
```

```bash
# kubectl get svc mongodb-service
NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
mongodb-service   ClusterIP   None         <none>        27017/TCP   15s
```

### Create and Deploy a StatefulSet

As a Kubernetes user, define and deploy a StatefulSet that specifies the number of replicas to be used for your application.
First, create secret for the key file. MongoDB will use this key to communicate with the internal cluster.

```bash
# openssl rand -base64 741 > key.txt
```

```bash
# kubectl create secret generic shared-bootstrap-data --from-file=internal-auth-mongodb-keyfile=key.txt
secret/shared-bootstrap-data created
```

Next we need to define specifications for the containerized application in the StatefulSet YAML file . The following sample specification requests one instance of the MongoDB application, specifies the external image to be used, and references the mongodb-sc storage class that you created earlier. This storage class maps to the Space-Efficient VM storage policy that you defined previously on the vSphere Client side.

Note that this manifest expects that the Kubernetes node can reach the image called `mongo:3.4`. If your Kubernetes nodes are not able to reach external repositories, then this YAML file needs to be modified to reach your local internal repo. Of course, this repo also needs to contain the Mongo image. We have set the number of replicas to 3, indicating that there will be 3 Pods, 3 PVCs and 3 PVs instantiated as part of this StatefulSet.

```bash
# cat mongodb-statefulset.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongod
spec:
  serviceName: mongodb-service
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      role: mongo
      environment: test
      replicaset: MainRepSet
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        role: mongo
        environment: test
        replicaset: MainRepSet
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongod-container
        image: mongo:3.4
        command:
        - "numactl"
        - "--interleave=all"
        - "mongod"
        - "--bind_ip"
        - "0.0.0.0"
        - "--replSet"
        - "MainRepSet"
        - "--auth"
        - "--clusterAuthMode"
        - "keyFile"
        - "--keyFile"
        - "/etc/secrets-volume/internal-auth-mongodb-keyfile"
        - "--setParameter"
        - "authenticationMechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-1"
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 0.2
            memory: 200Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets-volume
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: /etc/secrets-volume
        - name: mongodb-persistent-storage-claim
          mountPath: /data/db
      volumes:
      - name: secrets-volume
        secret:
          secretName: shared-bootstrap-data
          defaultMode: 256
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mongodb-persistent-storage-claim
      annotations:
        volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "mongodb-sc"
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

```bash
# kubectl create -f mongodb-statefulset.yaml
statefulset.apps/mongo created
```

Verify that the MongoDB application has been deployed.
Wait for pods to start running and PVCs to be created for each replica.

```bash
# kubectl get statefulset mongod
NAME     READY   AGE
mongod   3/3     96s
```

```bash
# kubectl get pod -l role=mongo
NAME       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mongod-0   1/1     Running   0          13h
mongod-1   1/1     Running   0          13h
mongod-2   1/1     Running   0          13h
```

```bash
# kubectl get pvc
NAME                                        STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
mongodb-persistent-storage-claim-mongod-0   Bound    pvc-ea98b22a-b8cf-11e9-b1d3-005056a0e4f0   1Gi        RWO            mongodb-sc     13h
mongodb-persistent-storage-claim-mongod-1   Bound    pvc-0267fa7d-b8d0-11e9-b1d3-005056a0e4f0   1Gi        RWO            mongodb-sc     13h
mongodb-persistent-storage-claim-mongod-2   Bound    pvc-24d86a37-b8d0-11e9-b1d3-005056a0e4f0   1Gi        RWO            mongodb-sc     13h
```

### Set up the Mongo replica set configuration

To setup the Mongo replica set configuration, we need to connect to one of the mongod container processes to configure the replica set.
Run the following command to connect to the first container. In the shell, initiate the replica set. You can rely on the host names to be the same, due to having employed the StatefulSet.

```bash
# kubectl exec -it mongod-0 -c mongod-container bash
root@mongod-0:/# mongo
MongoDB shell version v3.4.22
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 3.4.22
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
For interactive help, type "help".

> rs.initiate({_id: "MainRepSet", version: 1, members: [
... { _id: 0, host : "mongod-0.mongodb-service.default.svc.cluster.local:27017" },
... { _id: 1, host : "mongod-1.mongodb-service.default.svc.cluster.local:27017" },
... { _id: 2, host : "mongod-2.mongodb-service.default.svc.cluster.local:27017" }
...  ]});
{ "ok" : 1 }
```

This makes mongodb-0 the primary node and other two nodes are secondary.

### Verify Cloud Native Storage functionality is working in vSphere

After your application gets deployed, its state is backed by the VMDK file associated with the specified storage policy. As a vSphere administrator, you can review the VMDK that is created for your container volume.
In this step, we will verify that the Cloud Native Storage feature released with vSphere 6.7U3 is working. To go to the CNS UI, login to the vSphere client, then navigate to Datacenter → Monitor → Cloud Native Storage → Container Volumes and observe that the newly created persistent volumes are present. These should match the `kubectl get pvc` output from earlier. You can also monitor their storage policy compliance status.

![Cloud Native Storage view of the MongoDB Persistent Volumes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere/master/docs/images/cns-mongo-pvs-labels.png)

That completes the testing. CSI, CPI and CNS are all now working.

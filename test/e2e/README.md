# E2E test for cloud-provider-vsphere

## Requirements

In order to perform e2e tests against the cloud-provider-vsphere, make sure

* you have administrative access to a vSphere server
* golang 1.16+
* Docker ([download](https://www.docker.com/get-started))

## Environment variables

The first step to running the e2e tests is setting up the required environment variables in the [e2e config file](./config/vsphere-dev.yaml):

## Running the e2e tests

Checkout the e2e directory `PROJECT_ROOT/test/e2e` and run it with `make`.

Or run `make test-e2e` under the `PROJECT_ROOT`.
